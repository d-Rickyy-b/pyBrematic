# pyBrematic
This project offers a home for controlling your Brematic remote power outlets (and potentially other stuff) with the Python programming language. With the help of the community we might get other devices working aswell.

Currently this projects focusses on the [Brennenstuhl RCR 1000N](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01BZW4SW2) and the corresponding [Brematic Home Automation Gateway GWY 433](https://www.brennenstuhl.com/index.php?module=products&index[products][action]=details&index[products][data][products_id]=11079).

### Example usage
To check out how to use the module, go to the [example file](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pyBrematic/blob/master/pyBrematic/example/main.py) where I wrote a little example script, to show how to use the module.
