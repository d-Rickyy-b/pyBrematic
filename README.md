# pyBrematic
This project offers a home for controlling your Brematic remote power outlets (and potentially other stuff) with the Python programming language. With the help of the community we might get other devices working aswell.

Currently this projects focusses on the [Brennenstuhl RCR 1000N](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01BZW4SW2) and the corresponding [Brematic Home Automation Gateway GWY 433](https://www.brennenstuhl.com/index.php?module=products&index[products][action]=details&index[products][data][products_id]=11079).

### Installation
You can simply install the module via [pip](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(Python)) like this:

`pip install pyBrematic`

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure to use the Python 3 package manager:

`pip3 install pyBrematic`

And if you are having issues with installing the package, try to use the `--user` switch, to [install it to your home directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42988977/what-is-the-purpose-pip-install-user).

### Example usage
To check out how to use the module, go to the [example file](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pyBrematic/blob/master/pyBrematic/example/main.py) where I wrote a little example script, to show how to use the module.
